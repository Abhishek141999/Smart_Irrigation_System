Steps to setup RaspberryPI : 

	-> First we installed RaspberryPI OS in the sd card.
	-> Connected RaspberryPI with the laptop using LAN and gave it power supply.
	-> Installed Putty.
	-> Connected RaspberryPI with Putty by entering username and password.
	-> Installed VNC Viewer to control RaspberryPI OS.

Steps to connect Sensor : 
	
	-> Sensor which is used is DHT11 which measures temperature and Humidity
	-> The sensor has three pins - Vcc, Data, Gnd
	-> Connected Vcc of sensor to RaspberryPI 5V, Data of sensor to GPIO4 of RaspberryPI and Gnd of sensor to Gnd of RaspberryPI.

Getting Readings from the Sensor : 

	-> Installed Adafruit_DHT library
	-> Wrote a program which uses read_retry function from the Adafruit_DHT module to read the inputs given by sensor.
